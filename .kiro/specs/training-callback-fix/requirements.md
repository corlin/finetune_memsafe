# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses a critical training failure in the Qwen3 fine-tuning system where the `MemoryMonitoringCallback` class is missing required callback methods that the Hugging Face Transformers Trainer framework expects. The system currently fails with errors like "'MemoryMonitoringCallback' object has no attribute 'on_epoch_begin'" which prevents successful model training.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a machine learning engineer, I want the memory monitoring callback to be compatible with the Transformers Trainer framework, so that training can proceed without callback method errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Trainer calls callback methods THEN the MemoryMonitoringCallback SHALL have all required callback methods implemented
2. WHEN training starts THEN the system SHALL NOT fail with "object has no attribute" errors for callback methods
3. WHEN epoch begins THEN the callback SHALL handle the on_epoch_begin method call
4. WHEN epoch ends THEN the callback SHALL handle the on_epoch_end method call
5. IF additional callback methods are required THEN the callback SHALL implement them with appropriate functionality

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the callback methods to maintain memory monitoring functionality, so that GPU memory is still properly tracked during training.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN on_epoch_begin is called THEN the system SHALL log memory status at epoch start
2. WHEN on_epoch_end is called THEN the system SHALL log memory status at epoch end
3. WHEN any callback method executes THEN the system SHALL continue existing memory monitoring behavior
4. WHEN memory usage is high THEN the callback SHALL trigger cleanup operations as before
5. IF memory monitoring fails THEN the callback SHALL handle errors gracefully without stopping training

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive callback method coverage, so that the training system is robust against future Transformers framework updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Trainer framework calls any standard callback method THEN the callback SHALL respond appropriately
2. WHEN new callback methods are added to Transformers THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully
3. WHEN callback methods receive parameters THEN the callback SHALL process them correctly
4. WHEN logging callback events THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent log formatting
5. IF unknown callback methods are called THEN the system SHALL log warnings but continue execution
