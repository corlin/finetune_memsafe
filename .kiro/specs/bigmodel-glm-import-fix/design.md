# Design Document

## Overview

This design addresses the BigModel GLM API integration issues by implementing proper error handling, API key validation, and fixing missing imports. The solution focuses on making the demo scripts robust and user-friendly while maintaining compatibility with the existing evaluation system.

## Architecture

The fix involves three main components:
1. **Data Models Enhancement** - Add missing EvaluationDimension class
2. **API Adapter Improvements** - Enhanced error handling and validation
3. **Demo Script Fixes** - Better user experience and error reporting

## Components and Interfaces

### Data Models
- Add `EvaluationDimension` class to `industry_evaluation.models.data_models`
- Ensure compatibility with existing evaluation workflows

### API Adapter Enhancements
- Improve API key validation in OpenAI-compatible adapter
- Add specific error handling for BigModel GLM API responses
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff

### Demo Script Improvements
- Better error messages for API key issues
- Clear guidance for users on how to resolve problems
- Robust health check implementation

## Data Models

```python
class EvaluationDimension:
    """Represents an evaluation dimension for model assessment"""
    def __init__(self, name: str, weight: float = 1.0, threshold: float = 0.5):
        self.name = name
        self.weight = weight
        self.threshold = threshold
```

## Error Handling

- API key validation before making requests
- Specific error messages for different failure types
- Retry logic for transient failures
- Clear user guidance for resolution

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for new EvaluationDimension class
- Integration tests for API adapter improvements
- Manual testing of demo scripts with various error scenarios
