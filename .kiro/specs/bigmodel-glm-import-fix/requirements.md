# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses multiple issues in the BigModel GLM demo scripts that prevent successful API integration testing. The primary issues include: import errors where `EvaluationDimension` is missing from the data models module, API key validation failures that show "API密钥无效或已过期" errors, and inadequate error handling for API connectivity issues. These problems prevent developers from successfully testing BigModel's GLM API integration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to run the BigModel GLM demo script without import errors, so that I can test the GLM API integration successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the BigModel GLM demo script is executed THEN the system SHALL NOT raise ImportError for EvaluationDimension
2. WHEN the script imports from industry_evaluation.models.data_models THEN all imported classes SHALL exist in the target module
3. WHEN the script runs successfully THEN it SHALL be able to test BigModel GLM API calls without import-related failures

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the EvaluationDimension class to be properly defined in the data models, so that it can be used consistently across the evaluation system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN EvaluationDimension is imported THEN the class SHALL be available in industry_evaluation.models.data_models
2. WHEN EvaluationDimension is instantiated THEN it SHALL provide the necessary attributes for evaluation dimensions
3. WHEN the class is used in evaluation workflows THEN it SHALL integrate seamlessly with existing data models

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want unused imports to be cleaned up in demo scripts, so that the codebase remains maintainable and free of unnecessary dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing demo script imports THEN only necessary imports SHALL be present
2. WHEN imports are not used in the script THEN they SHALL be removed to avoid confusion
3. WHEN the script is executed THEN it SHALL only import what it actually uses

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper API key validation and clear error messages, so that I can quickly identify and resolve authentication issues with BigModel GLM API.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an invalid or expired API key is provided THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message indicating the API key issue
2. WHEN API key validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific guidance on how to obtain and set a valid API key
3. WHEN the API key format is incorrect THEN the system SHALL validate the key format before making API calls
4. WHEN network connectivity issues occur THEN the system SHALL distinguish between authentication errors and network errors

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust error handling for API connectivity issues, so that I can troubleshoot BigModel GLM integration problems effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls timeout THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff up to 3 attempts
2. WHEN rate limiting occurs THEN the system SHALL wait appropriately and retry the request
3. WHEN API endpoints are unreachable THEN the system SHALL provide clear network connectivity error messages
4. WHEN API responses contain errors THEN the system SHALL parse and display meaningful error information

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the health check functionality to work correctly, so that I can verify BigModel GLM API connectivity before running full evaluations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN health check is performed THEN the system SHALL make a minimal API call to verify connectivity
2. WHEN health check succeeds THEN the system SHALL report the API as healthy and ready for use
3. WHEN health check fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific failure reasons and troubleshooting guidance
4. WHEN health check encounters authentication errors THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate API key issues
